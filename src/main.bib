    abstract = {Due to the rapid development of the information technology and wide use of the Internet, Information is easily to be obtained in the form of digital format. Digital content can be freely printed into documents since the convenience and accessibility of the printers. On the other hand, printed documents can be illegally manipulated by some criminal issues such as: forged documents, counterfeit currency, copyright infringement, and so on. Therefore, how to develop an efficient and appropriate safety testing tool to identify the source of printed documents is an important task in the meantime. Currently, the forensic system using the statistical methods and support vector machine technology has been able to identify the source printer for the text and the image documents. Such an approach belongs to the category of shallow machine learning with human interaction during the stages of feature extraction, feature selection and data pre-processing. In this paper, a deep learning system to solve the complex image classification problem is developed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) of deep learning which can learn the features automatically. Systematic experiments have been performed for both systems. For microscopic documents, feature based SVM system outperforms the deep learning system with limited gap. For scanned documents, both system can achieve equally well with high accuracy. Both systems should be constantly evaluated and compared for the best interest in universal utilization.}

    abstract = {Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been identified by the European Commission as a key enabler of interoperability among private and public undertakings. Further, a systematic adoption of open and standardized APIs by firms and developers appears crucial to unlock competition and ultimately promote the flourishing of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) innovation. Analysing the main European regulatory initiatives which have so far surfaced in the realm of data governance (right to personal data portability, free flow of non-personal data, access to customer account data rule, re-use of government data), it seems that the EU legislator is not tackling the matter consistently. Indeed, on one side, all these initiatives share a strong reliance on APIs as a key facilitator to ensure a sound and effective data sharing ecosystem. However, on the other side, all these attempts are inherently different in terms of rationale, scope and implementation. The article stresses that data sharing via APIs requires a complex implementation process and sound standardization initiatives are essential for its success. Moreover, data pooling agreements need to be targeted in advance by competition law so to incentivize their adoption and leverage their pro-competitive potential. As for pricing and compensation issues, we point out that placing excessive reliance on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms might be counterproductive.}

    abstract = {Recently, due to the increase in popularity of the Internet, the problem of digital data security over the Internet is increasing at a phenomenal rate. Watermarking is used for various notable applications to secure digital data from unauthorized individuals. To achieve this, in this article, we propose a joint encryption then-compression based watermarking technique for digital document security. This technique offers a tool for confidentiality, copyright protection, and strong compression performance of the system. The proposed method involves three major steps as follows: (1) embedding of multiple watermarks through non-sub-sampled contourlet transform, redundant discrete wavelet transform, and singular value decomposition; (2) encryption and compression via SHA-256 and Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW), respectively; and (3) extraction/recovery of multiple watermarks from the possibly distorted cover image. The performance estimations are carried out on various images at different attacks, and the efficiency of the system is determined in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized correlation (NC), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), number of changing pixel rate (NPCR), unified averaged changed intensity (UACI), and compression ratio (CR). Furthermore, the comparative analysis of the proposed system with similar schemes indicates its superiority to them.},
